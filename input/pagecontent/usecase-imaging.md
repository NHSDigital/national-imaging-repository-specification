## Problem Statement

NHS Radiology faces significant challenges in enabling inter-organisational access to patients' historical diagnostic images and reports, which is crucial for ensuring continuity of care. The current reliance on the Image Exchange Portal (IEP) to share imaging studies across Trusts or Imaging Networks is fraught with inefficiencies, leading to delays and frustration for clinicians. These limitations result in unnecessary patient re-imaging and resource wastage, costing approximately Â£4 million annually. A solution is needed to provide seamless access to historical radiological imaging studies across all hospital sites, regardless of where the study was originally conducted.

| DICOM          | Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine is the global standard for medical images developed by American College of Radiology (ACR) and National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Imaging Report | An imaging report reflects the observations and interpretations of one or more imaging studies. It usually contains elements such as the reason why the study is requested, relevant contextual medical information, the used modality and its settings, procedures and body localisations that were used, a description of the observations and findings, exposure information, conclusion and advice.                                                                                          |
| Imaging Study  | An imaging study comprises a set of objects, including images and other objects, that were made for a specific purpose and usually in response to a request from a healthcare provider. The Imaging Study does not include the Imaging Report as defined in this guideline. Imaging Study in this context does not refer to the FHIR Resource ImagingStudy - FHIR v4.0.1 (hl7.org)                                                                                                               |
| PACS           | Picture Archiving and Communication System. <br/><br/> A PACS consists of three major components: a secure network for the transmission of imaging and patient information, workstations for interpreting and reviewing images, and archives for the storage and retrieval of images and reports. Combined with web technology, a PACS has the ability to deliver timely and efficient access to images, interpretations, and related data. A PACS is usually linked to a Hospital Information System. |
| RIS            | Radiology Information System. <br/><br/> The main functions of a RIS are the patient scheduling, resource management, examination performance tracking, reporting, results distribution, and procedure billing. Typically, it is integrated in the HIS and the PACS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Any necessary follow-up actions are scheduled based on the retrieved imaging studies and reports.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Main Course                            | 1. Clinician wants to search for and retrieve a patientâs radiology image: <br/> -    Clinician identifies the need to access previous imaging studies and reports.<br/><br/>2.    Clinician queries system for a list of imaging studies and reports for patient:<br/>-    Clinician enters the patientâs identifier.<br/>-    Clinician provides additional query parameters, such as time period, modality, study procedure, body part, or procedure code, if needed.<br/>3.    List of imaging studies and/or reports returned to clinician:<br/>-    System displays a list of imaging studies and reports matching the query parameters.<br/><br/>4.    Clinician selects (including filtering, ordering, grouping) and requests the relevant imaging studies and/or reports:<br/>-    Clinician reviews the list, applies any necessary filters, orders or groups the results, and selects the relevant studies and/or reports.<br/><br/>5.   If required, after clinician has reviewed imaging report they can retrieve the relevant imaging study<br/><br/>6.    The requested imaging studies and/or reports are sent to the clinician. In case there are multiple versions of studies/reports, the latest versions are provided:<br/>-    System retrieves the selected studies and/or reports, ensuring the latest versions are included, and sends them to the clinician.<br/><br/>7.    Clinician  is presented with the requested imaging studies and/or reports:<br/>-    Clinician views the retrieved imaging studies and reports on their interface.<br/><br/>8.    Clinician  uses the imaging studies and/or reports to provide healthcare service:<br/>-    Clinician reviews the images and reports to inform diagnosis, treatment planning, or other healthcare decisions. |
| Alternate Course                       | 1. Clinician refines the search with additional unique patient identifiers or search criteria to ensure the correct patient records are retrieved, if not initially successful                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
