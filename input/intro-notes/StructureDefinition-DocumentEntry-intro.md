## Entity Model

This is based on both FHIR [DocumentReference](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/documentreference.html) and IHE (Europe) [Document Metadata](https://www.ihe-europe.net/sites/default/files/2017-11/IHE_ITI_XDS_Metadata_Guidelines_v1.0.pdf) (this contains references to NHS England terminology)

## Entity Mapping and Description

For HL7 v2 MDM T02, see [HL7 v2 MDM T02 Mapping](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/v2-to-fhir/ConceptMap-message-mdm-t02-to-bundle.html) 

Note: links to HL7 FHIR Practitioner has removed several IHE XDS Document Entry fields, and just retained identifier and name. It is expected these values would be available via the NHS England Healthcare Worker API which may conform to [IHE Mobile Care Services Discovery (mCSD)](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/mCSD/index.html) interface contracts.

- NHS England Data Dictionary [IMAGING CODE (SNOMED CT)](https://www.datadictionary.nhs.uk/data_elements/imaging_code__snomed_ct_.html) 
  - NHS England Terminology Browser [Refset 999001111000000105](https://termbrowser.nhs.uk/?perspective=full&conceptId1=999001111000000105&edition=uk-edition&release=v20240731&server=https://termbrowser.nhs.uk/sct-browser-api/snomed&langRefset=999001261000000100,999000691000001104)
- NHS England [National Interim Clinical Imaging Procedure code set](https://nhsengland.kahootz.com/t_c_home/view?objectID=45878224) which mentions a **ConceptMap** to SNOMED CT (according Data Dictionary for Care (DD4C) NICIP, and the SNOMED refset are all referring to the same procedures)

NICIP in both native and SNOMED versions contains several thousand codes, this may not be suitable for general searches from non radiologists. 
Also, DICOM Categories may be suitable for searching (for non radiologists) but is not included in IHE Europe documentations, need to find out if this has been considered.

**Note this probably requires a ConceptMap**


### Practice Setting

Both IHE and HL7 refer to clinical specialty where the event took place. UK Core has taken a Service route using SNOMED CT codes.

#### Option 1 Service 

TODO - This is referring to [NHS Data Model and Dictionary - TREATMENT FUNCTION CODE](https://www.datadictionary.nhs.uk/attributes/treatment_function_code.html)
and [UKCoreCareSettingType](https://simplifier.net/hl7fhirukcorer4/valueset-ukcore-caresettingtype)

NHS England is probably creating a new CodeSystem on the Ontology Server

**Note this probably requires a ConceptMap**

#### Option 2 Specialty

In FHIR this would also be available via author.PractitionerRole.specialty

This is referring to [MAIN SPECIALTY CODE](https://www.datadictionary.nhs.uk/attributes/main_specialty_code.html) and [UKCorePracticeSettingCode](https://simplifier.net/hl7fhirukcorer4/valueset-ukcore-practicesettingcode)

Note this appears to be a source of confusion as practiceSetting is being linked to treatment-function-codes elsewhere.
